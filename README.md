# This is my Website Github Repo.

My website will be updated from a local repo then to githup and then the VPS pulls from the repo updating the website. After its been uploaded to the website it will refresh and the website will use the new code. 

### Model Design

## Overview!

The VPS I am using is currently Oracles Always Free Tier using a VM with 4(ARM) CPU cores and 24GB of RAM and 200GB of storage. 
You can find it here: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/

I then use NGINX installed on the VPS to host the website
You can find more information on the install of Nginx here: https://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html

Lastly I use Github and a CRON task to pull the latest repo from github.


All of my code for this will be available and free for anyone to use. I plan to update this website with any of my local documentation and anything that I find useful within my professional work and homelab use case. 

## Process of Creation!
## Warning!!!! 
I am not a developer or a professional code slinger, this is just a hobby using things I learned from school/hobby.
