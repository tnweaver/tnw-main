        <P>Hi all, very busy lately and have not had the time to work on any of my side projects. Now that I do have some time I am planning on adding more projects to the website/github as well as starting to do more custom 3d print projects as well.</P>
        <p>I am also planning on first doing a full documentation of my homelab setup and the different configs that I have done with each system.(updated monthly or more realisticly yearly)</p>
