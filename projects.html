    <h1>Projects Page</h1>
    <p>This page will host all of my various project documentation and hopefully it will stay updated but I can not say for sure.</p>
    <p>I plan to put most of the processes that I have done in my homelab down as it will be good not just for others but also for myself and to utilize.</p>
